rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,f1b5,"I don't think that this is a good 2nd move for White, since I can drive the bishop back, and in the bargain get a6 (the najdorf move) without spending tempo on it. Thats why I played a6."
rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/1Bp5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,a7a6,"a6 looks to be the correct move here. Nc6 would just put your knight in a position that justifies his dubious bishop move. Bb5 is a move that works when the knight is already on c6 or in systems where the black d pawn has already moved. Here you are correct, it is a wasted tempo, and your move is quite correct."
rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/1Bp5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,b5c4,"Now, this is a position I have met a LOT by FICS players. That is, that they play 1. e4 followed by 2. Bc4. I do not know why this is used so commonly, since it is not a book move in the sicilian. Does this move have any value? In my opinion it looses foothold in the centre. The reason most people play Bc4 on the second move is that they started playing chess by playing Qh5 on the third move trying to mate quickly with the queen raid, and are so used to playing the Bishop to that square that they do not know any better. These players are not familair with sicilian or other non head-pawn systems (i.e. e4, e5) that they just play the move by rote."
rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,e7e6,"Preparing a strike at d5. In the sicilian, if black can effect an early d5 without loss of material, all other things being equal, black has equalized. White has done nothing to prevent this so far other than let you have free moves."
rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,b1c3,"Nf3 would have been a slight improvement here. Nc3 stops whites c pawn from advancing, which is a key pawn to help contest the center. Black can now play just about any pawn move at will here. White has given up the first move initiative."
rnbqkbnr/3p1ppp/p3p3/1pp5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,c4e2,"I have trapped several bishops in blitz games by this set-up, but my plan here is to kick the bishop away from the diagonal, and thus control the d5 square. It's a good idea to assume that your opponent will play the best move and plan accordingly. When you played b5, Bb3 should have not even entered your mind. It only costs you needless thought processing on a move that just loses that you could spend on strategy on what happens on the only reply which is Be2. Not saying that you did spend that much time on that move, but it is good advice nonetheless."
rnbqkbnr/3p1ppp/p3p3/1pp5/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,c8b7,"A normal developing move. Please make comments if you find soemething wrong with the move order, or suggest better plans of delevopement than what is done here. Bb7 is probably best. Nc6 is also a fine move. It is still early in the opening, and black needs to start developing, so either move is fine. Black has to keep in consideration the d4 break for white. White wants to get his Knight to f3 and play d4 as soon as possible, freeing his game. White has not played the best moves so far and black has responded nicely."
rn1qkbnr/1b1p1ppp/p3p3/1pp5/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,e2f3,"I don't mean to be negative but this move is just terrible. He has moved the bishop now for the 4th time! From b5-c4-e2-f3. The knight belongs on that square. Strategically speaking, he has given up the square he needs for the knight, where it will control the important e5 square, and now the bishop is just ""biting on granite"" so to speak. White's play is not impressive. Black can now mobilize quickly and at will, since white has presented no problems for the black player whatsoever. White had the first move but is already defending!"
rn1qkbnr/1b1p1ppp/p3p3/1pp5/4P3/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 6,d7d6,"This is the first move that I do not like for black. This pawn wants to go to d5 to equalize as discussed before... thus it has made a move already. Now to play d5, it will have to move again, wasting a tempo, when if it is held back, it can be played in one move later on. Also, Black should develop pieces, and take advantage of whites lack of development and play Nge7. (Nf6 would be hairy because of e5.)"
rn1qkbnr/1b3ppp/p2pp3/1pp5/4P3/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,d2d3,"White needs to develop here. The pawn needs to go to d4 eventually, so reccommended is Nge2 to facilitate castling before his king gets stuck in the center."
rn1qkbnr/1b3ppp/p2pp3/1pp5/4P3/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,b8c6,I might have developed the king knight here instead to speed up castling.
r2qkbnr/1b3ppp/p1npp3/1pp5/4P3/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,a2a3,"Again, another wasted move that could be used on development. White is in great danger of getting stuck in the center. Black needs to develop his kingside pieces quickly and break the center open to punish white for his lazy play."
r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p1nppn2/1pp3B1/4P3/P1NP1B2/1PP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 9,g7g6,"Here is a change in what I usually play. I usually puts the bishop on e7, which is normal in many sicilian systems, but here I wanted to exploit the fact that the dark long diagonal is wide open, AND that I control the dark central squares. Is this correct judgement, or would it be better with Be7? Be7! I would like to say a few things about g6 (which is a mistake in my view). First, if you notice, there are squares at h6, and f6 that have suddenly become weak. Granted yes, the bishop can protect it, but white can quickly remove the bishop by Qd2 and Black will find it quite difficult to castle. Even if black plays h6, the bishop will have abandoned d6 and when white plays Bf4, that pawn will be under attack, and there will be dark squared weaknesses all around blacks kingside. Second, the Bishop already had a way to get out via e7, which would allow black to castle on the next move. With g6, black has to play Bg7 next, instead of castling, and spend an extra move to castle. Third, the d6 pawn is currently a little backward. It is not yet by definition, but as soon as white plays d4 it will be. Thus it will be a weakness later on. Since Black has played c5, e6, AND Bg7, that pawn is left with only one defender, the queen. The bishop will be left with double duty, to protect the weakened dark squares, and to help protect the d6 pawn (since the queen will be unable to do it by itself, even with one rook under it.) White will be able to pile up his rooks on that file and win the pawn easily. Regarding the control of the long diagonal. This is normally a very good strategy. This particular position though you are mixing two strategies. You mentioned before that it is a Najdorf move to play a6, but now you have adopted a dragon system. First The two systems do not work well together. You should stick with the original plan that you embarked upon which was working quite well for you. Second, the dragon system is effective when white castles queenside and you have an open c file, neither of which you have. So the bishop will have control of that diagonal, yes... but all by itself. It needs to be part of an overall plan, which in a Najdorf it is not if it is on g7. Also as an additional note, there is an interesting tactical idea here that white can try as a retort which is a temporary pawn sac. White can play 10 e5!? right away. The variation would be . ..dxe5 11 Ne4 Be7 12 Bxf6 Bxf6 13 Nxc5 and white will have messed up blacks pawn structure a little, and provided an outpost for his knight on c5."

It is always of value to try to find the idea of your opponent. The move is most likely a dubious one, but it may be based on a cheapo or a trap, and if you dismiss it, you may miss his cheapo and lose a piece or even the game! Always ask yourself, what is my opponents plan when he makes a move, even if it looks like a ridiculous move. As players and competitors we have a tendency to criticize our opponents moves but not realize that they are making moves that they think make sense and that they think have a perfectly good reason to play. My assessment of this move is that he wants to play b4, to strike at your imposing queenside pawns, and he could not do this with his rook on a1. After Rb1, he can play b4, then cxb4, axb4, and now he can play d4 with out any challenge from your c pawn. I am not saying that this is the BEST plan, but my guess is that is what his move was meant for."

Not only one more waste of good tempo, but also the loss of casteling options. The king is stuck in the centre, and I feel like I have an advantage in the centre at this point. In my opinion White is worse. This rook move seems to begin a g pawn thrust, though it seems unneccesary since the pawn can go on its own. Center control is about even with Black having an ever so slight edge. The thing you should take note of here though is very evident. Whites last move was a gross error. Black has also made an error in not capitolizing on it. There are many factors that contribute to that assessment. Let me explain. White with his last move can now never castle. That is obvious. But the reason that is such an error is that the center is fluid! Blacks move here is not Kh7, but g5 followed by d5! ripping open the center. White's king is hopelessly lost in the center and will never get out, trapped in by his own pieces and pawns. Black has all the fire power he needs available to go right down the d and e files and piledrive the king into oblivion. 14. O-O was definitely called for here."

I found no clear ways to do so, but that was my plan, so I started to reroute my knight to a4, with the plan of removing the b2 defender. Here is the first major error in judgement that I think you have made in this game. You mentioned that when you castled you wanted to thrust in the center, and now you are talking about taking whites queen, which seems to be diverting from that plan. If white were going to be gracious enough to leave his king on e1 long enough to allow you to set up a very long term plan to do this, this would not be a very good game to analyze. The analysis from what I can see is you are trying to provoke a b3 advance so you can play b4, and hope that he plays axb or something else, and then you can play Bxc3 winning the queen. Coming up with a ""dream position"" as IM Silman calls it is a very good thing to do, but the second thing he mentions is, ""can you realize that plan?"". Here, I do not believe you can, since all white has to do is move his King to f1 and the whole tactic falls apart, and you have to figure out what to do with all the moves you made. Do they serve any other additional purpose? If this tactic is a nice side effect of a long term plan, i.e. ""I am trying to get an outpost for my knight on c4, and white cannot play b3 because he will lose his knight and queen to my bishop."" That would be different. But here the moves will all be for naught when white moves his king off the diagonal. The moves you use toward this tactic would be better used to continue with your original plan (which was quite a good idea) which was after you said you wanted to castle, you wanted to thrust in the center."

All your game, from the beginning, was attack, attack, attack. Suddenly, you're in a complex ending. In such a change, be careful. Stay calm, think a long time, and change your mind: you're in an ending, no more in a tactical attack. You must be ready for that."

In this position the center is firmly blocked: White must choose his plan among a queen-side pawn storm (preparing c4, b4, and then c5, better with Rooks in b1 and c1) and a King attack, whose the first step is to remove the bishop in g7 (in order to create ""holes"" around the black king). The Knight in d2 doesn't suite neither the first plan nor the second. Another possibility could have been Ne1, leaving the square d2 for the queen and keeping both plans possible. From e1 the Knight can go later in d3, controlling the point c5, or come back in f3 after the push in f4 (trying to open lines against the enemy king)"

I think that if White had taken the opportunity on move 26 you may have felt that you never really got into the game at all. There are better lines to choose which will give you more play in the middlegame so have a study and find one that you feel comfortable with. I think that your assessment of the position throughout was very good so you understand the plus and minus points of positions which leads me to believe that if you find better lines you will get better middlegames. Your ability in the endgame won the day and I would congratulate you on that this is a very great asset to have. Many thanks for allowing me to review the game and Well Done.

He has not only the Bishop pair in an opened position, but the initiative too. He threatens here f5, which would leave Black with only three ranks to play.

You should do more effort if you like to improve it, these include: 1.Do more investigation before making a move, more explicitly, try to evaluate the position rather than simply calculate moves. Taking this game for instance, where you go wrong is the 11th move, that is of high probability due to having not evaluated the position and been eager to start attack. 2.Get familiar with frequently used openings, and understand the ideas they imply. You said you have no idea on what to do after 13th move. I think if you had an explicit thought with the opening you had chosen, you won't be unable to make a fit move. Good luck!"

I believe you could have obtained good winning chances on move 15 and that you lost the game on move 24 (and never really recovered from there onwards). This game was quite calm at the start, but eventually both sides started attacking the opponent's king and things got very tactical. In both types of position - calm and tactical - you noticed that you should always be careful not to overlook any tactical opportunities and/or problems, but you also need to think in terms of long term plans. Especially in calm situations like early in this game tactical considerations aren't always that important and winning or losing a tempo or two often doesn't really matter. In such situations you might want to consider where you would like to place all of your pieces, what sort of pawn structure you can and/or would like to achieve and how you can eventually open the game up (e.g. by pawn advances etc.). Both sides didn't really do this and played without any consistent plan, until an attack on the opponent's king became the absolutely obvious thing to do. However even if that is what you want and need to do, it still doesn't mean that a sacrifical attack is the best way of going about it - but judging that really requires tactical calculations and experience, which is probably best gained by playing over master games. Doing that also gives a certain idea of how one should place one's pieces. I hope my review does help and good luck."

After the game I thought about this position, black's d6 pawn is somehow weak, maybe I should play Nb5-a3-c4 to set up pressure on it. At the moment I just didn't have a clear plan. Killerman: Be3 is OK, but c4 might be more in keeping with the position. You will hold the d5 pawn and if a6 the knight can jump back to c3. I think that your knight moves would not work because Black is quite likely to set up a6 and b5 and kick your knight out of c4. In addition I can't see how you would get enough pieces to pressure the d6 square. I think that is why I would prefer the more natural c4 which fits better with your development planning. There will be natural squares for the pieces to go to and Black will have a slightly more cramped position but will still aim to play f5."

Black is setting up the natural pawn centre and will be looking to attack on the kingside with pieces behind his pawns. If that is the case you are more likely to get success by attacking on the queenside. What you can't do is open up the kingside because Black's pieces will flood over there.

It is very necessary to play f3 here before starting on a queenside attack. You can't afford to open up the kingside as you pieces are actually pointing more towards the queenside. The move f3 will slow down the attack from Black. Your move f4 actually weakens weakens your whole centre position. If you allowed Black to play f4 himself then Bc1 would be OK as Black has very kindly given over the e4 square for your pieces. I also think that Black might actually be able to take on f4 now as you cannot safetly re-capture. See the following lines.

My only criticism is that if you should be playing on the queenside you are likely to need it on c3, but it won't be too far away on e3 I guess, it just takes time and I don't know if you can afford that time as Black is starting his attack now. I think from your comments it is clear that you had not considered attacking on the queenside. This is actually quite natural as usually we want to be attacking the king. However you do have a queenside pawn majority which you can use. i.e. b4 followed by c5 which will create threats which Black will need to answer."

Well quite simply you did not get started with the correct plan and ran out of ideas very early. Your position became very passive and whilst Black may well be a similar grade he had a very natural attack. Yours was not so obvious but was necessary as Black's attack was always going to come quickly once he had established his centre and you had played f4. As I pointed out earlier it is natural to look to hunt the king down but often we can't do that directly, so we must play on the side of the board we are stronger, this will help to distract our opponent away from their plan and their king. We can also just as easily win material which may become vital in an endgame. If your opponent had castled queenside then I am sure you would have thrust your pawns at him. So give it a try in another game. Good luck with your chess in the future and many thanks for allowing me to review your game I hope my comments help."

In my opinion, although it entails more risks Black should play more actively by taking the gambit pawn, and then try to keep it by pushing g5 at some point like in the Fischer or Kieseretsky Defences. Other good choices are the Modern and Cunningham defences. E: This move by itself isn't passive - black can still take on the next move and go into the Fischer defence, for instance. If Black wants to keep it closed, it might be better to get the Bishop out to c5 first. But this can't really be a bad move by itself."

I don't think that's a very useful comparison - f4 totally changes the position. For instance, after 0-0 and Nf6, in the Spanish white often covers his pawn with Re1, to build a center with c3 and d4, in the meantime giving his bishop a safe spot on c2. Both Re1 and the c3-d4 plan don't look good with f4 already played. I think Bc4, aiming for f7, looks more logical."

However, this means giving the bishop pair to Black and since I've become more sensible lately to the power of the bishop pair, I tend to keep it. Another reason is that I don't see clearly what kind of compensation White would get in this position from exchanging bishop for knight: bxc6 gives Black a strong centre, and Bxc6 will put the Bishop on a nice diagonal that Black could try later to open by pushing d5. I did not want to play Ba4 either for the same reason: After b5, White has to exchange or must play Bb3 and after Na5 Black will force the exchange. Compare the situation here with the one in the Spanish Exchange, where White gets a clear compensation for the exchange of his bishop. E: I believe Bxc6 is consistent. If that is better for Black, then it was Bb5 that was wrong, not taking on c6. After that, a position arises where White must make outposts for his knights, and keep it closed as much as possible - like 7.Bxc6 Bxc6 8.fxe5 dxe5 9.d3 or something, when White has reasonable prospects."

E: One of the things Silman explains about fantasy positions is that you should see if Black can defend even if you manage to obtain your fantasy position.

First, I think it important to remember to review and try to actively practice general opening principles such as harmonious piece development and king safety. Secondly, I felt that your moves were not cohesive--you made one-move threats or reacting to your opponent's moves without considering your own plans. One method to improve this is to study strategy particularly from games of masters. If you study the games of Capablanca, you will see that sometimes he has several moves that look good, but he chooses the move that furthers his overall plan (e.g. controlling a file or square or improving the position of a piece). Finally, although this is related to the previous point, I feel that you are not considering your opponent's forcing moves in your calculations. You must expect your opponent to play the best move and then have a move ready in reply to what you believe his best move will be. This is not easy, but if you work on this, I think you will be amazed at how fast you improve as you start to eliminate simple blunders based on erroneous calculation. Of course, tactical study will help in this regard as well. I hope these recommendations help. Good luck."""

Generally are there rules or typical reasons when a d5 of Black would be premature? Killerman: A few questions there. In answer to the first an immediate d5 has to be unsound in principal as with the Black King in the centre opening the e-file is not going to be the greatest idea. In addition Black will end up with an isolated pawn on d5 which will be a target. Standard play around an isolated pawn is to place a piece in front of it and then shoot at it and I think White can do this comfortably as the following variations illustrate. Even in the best line for Black he is in for a very long struggle at best. There are sounder moves here so a possible d5 should wait until development is complete..

Is it possible or better for White to play f4 without Nb3 and how will White react on Qb6 then? Killerman: You are worried about pressure on the b pawn and a possible capture. But this attack would not be a good idea for Black. White has a perfectly good response to Qb6 as the following shows so an immediate f4 is correct here. Black does best not to put the queen on b6 as the b pawn cannot be safely attacked and it is also wrong to be putting the queen opposite White's bishop. Qc7 is the normal response to f4. Your Nb3 move is just too passive to be good and is not really in keeping with the position, this loss of time with the knight makes your next few moves and resulting middlegame more difficult than it ought to be."

Now I believe that Bd3 would have been better: The bishop eyes on the kingside too and if a knight will capture it the c2 pawn can recapture comfortably. Killerman: Yes, it is time for a plan and you have thought out some of the key points very well. Where I think your plan fails is attempting to play f5. I just don't think that this will work without you putting more pressure into the centre first. Developing your rooks after Qg3 by Rad1 then Rf2-d2 will do this. You will certainly have to watch out for b4 as Black will attack on the queenside. I also think he may consider moving his k-side knight d7-b6-c4 where he can pressure you still further."

On the other had maybe black has spent too much time with a6 and c6 - could black actually hope for something like that or would white be able to open the position up in the middlegame? Would playing f2-f3 right away have been better? I suppose a downside of 9.f3 would be that he might be able to play b5, because I block the diagonal of my bishop. Or would Qb3 or Qc1 followed by e.g. h3 be a better idea? The move you played in the game canNOT be bad. The endgame is too far away now, and if he exchanges his Bishop for your Ne2, later you could bring your Bg2 to the light with several possiblities, depending upon the sort of position (f4 followed by e5, or Bh3, and so on). The bishop pair could be very useful. Now the position is closed, but if it opens later, your bishops could be very powerful."

Admittedely the knight looks quite odd on c1, but the move seems necessary. If you are obliged to play here Nc1, somewhere, in your previous moves, there is an error.

Black has not pieces well placed to attack your castled king for the moment.

Here are some key points from the game with recommendations: 1. Black's rook was hanging for several moves. You were planning a kingside attack, but Black could have easily saved the rook with an advantage. When you are given a ""gift"" you should check if it is safe to take it (make sure there are no traps), and then gobble up the goodies. 2. You sacrificed the pawn on e4 early in the game. Usually, this is more effective when Black's king is still in the center, because you can often gain time and development with moves like Re1 when Black has to get his king to safety. 3. Playing stronger opponents is useful because they will punish you for your mistakes and cause you to correct them. Good luck!"

After the queen trade he was able to break out of the bind without danger to his king. The most noticable thing was your evaluation of pawn moves around the king (a2-a3, b2-b4, ...a6, ...bxc6 and not considering c2-c4). The transition to ending with the queen trade was very important but in a slightly different way. I'd say you need to consider the king's safety or weakness in every scenario involving pawn moves where it is (or might soon be) and how the king's safety is related to a queen (or even perhaps other pieces) trades. Think on that issue and work to improve your handling of those situations to keep more winning opportunities and limit or eliminate any losing lines. Good luck!"

I was afraid that the pawn on e4 would be a better tager for his f6 Knight. Is cxd4 better? Is it always better in positions like this? Are there any exceptions? TB: Let' start with your last question - there are *always* exceptions in chess. In this case I'm almost sure that cxd5 was better. With cxd5 you will be able to put the bishop on e2, play 0-0 and put a rook on c-file. When you play exd5 you block your bishop (that has to go to e2 anyway). And if you're trying to take the half-open e-file with Re1 your bishop will not be of any use on e2. The c4 pawn makes Rc1 rather useless. So I think exd5 lost a lot of tempi, since you block the possibilitys of developing your own pieces."

TB: Often Na6 is used to make white advance with his queensidepawns (look at the bishop on f5 - it has become very strong and it would get even stronger if black get his a6-knight into play on the queenside). In this position Nc7 isn't a good move for black becuase he blocks his R since the knight has no good squares after Nc7 (i e blacks knight is a little offside for now). What you should avoid in those positions is to advance too far with the pawns becuse blacks plan with Na6 is to create space for his own pieces between the white pawns and the rest of whites pieces (in this case you can see that b5 is bad because of Nc5).

Rd7!? then I might have saved the game even still. I believe I'd enter an endgame with a Rook, Bishop, and four pawns (one of which was dangerously passed) against his Queen and two pawns. I had PLENTY of time still on the clock, I just didn't bother using any of it to evaluate my 42nd move. I just considered the game over and proceded with this lacking attack. So I guess my question is how did I end up in this aweful position and how do I keep it from happening. TB: I guess you mean 42. Re7 with the idea 42...e1Q 43.Bxf5+ and then take the black bishop. On 42.Re7 black could play 42...b6+ (if 42...Kd8 43.Kd6 wins for white) and after 43.Kd4 Kd6 white play 44.Bb5 threatening 45.Rd7 mate (44...Kxe7 45.Bxe2). If black plays 43...Kd8 white can respond by 44.d6 e1Q 45.Bxf5 and black has no check that saves the bishop. 42...b6+ 43.Kd4 e1Q 44.Bxf5+ Kd8 44.Rxe4 and it seems like the game isn't over for white after all. / From what I see you know where you played wrong, the problem is that you don't know what to do instead. I recommend that you try different plans and see what is right for your style of play. I also think you should try to improve your endgame. I hope this will help you improve your play and if you have any question or would like me to explain what I meant in some position you're welcome to contact me online (and your questions doesn't have to be about this game). /ThoBjo"

You've probably heard of the general principles inregard to the opening, but since they are so often ""forgotten"" by beginners, I'll list them again: 1. Look after your pieces, don't lose them! 2. Fight for some control of the center! 3. Develop all your pieces quickly! 4. Ensure the safety of your king! One thing to do when following principle three is to NOT move any of your developed pieces a second time, until all of your pieces are in play (unless of course that needs to be done following principle 1). Ng5 of course does just the opposite, while your whole queenside ist still asleep, a serious loss of time, especially since the only ""point"" to it, the attack on f7 is easily refuted.

Qxc1 which results in the loss of a knight. I don't know what the better move would have been though. joeva: disregarding principle 3 again... Even if this would not lead to the immediate loss of a piece, it's just a bad move. an attack with just two minor pieces against an uncompromised and well defended kingside is absolutely hopeless, unless you expect your opponent to ignore you threats. Unfortunately that doesn't happen very often. Any development would have been way better, but it's already difficult, as Nc3 would be met with d4.

While your two lone attackers where off on a crusade, the rest of your army was still asleep in its barracks. This resulted in a weak back rank and consequently your opponent was able to exploit that to win a piece. It was all downhill from there as your opponent never returned the favor and quite safely converted his advantage to a full point, trading off your remaining pieces wherever possible. Still, if you remember to develop your pieces in future games, maybe work a little on your tactics and most importantly, practice - i.e. play regularly against challenging opponents - I'm quite sure, you'll see improvement!

O-O and 9.g4 are the preferred moves. 9. g4 leads to a free for all resembling your game but with one extra pair of minor pieces and a pawn wedge at the black king position.

I severly lacked development at this stage, so if White offers light square bishop, I develop my own light square bishop. akryl: An interesting move that forces the win of the bishop pair. An interesting point is that if your white bishop had moved o e6 it would have lost a tempo for you in recapturing at g4. As Bc8-e6xg4 compared to Bc8xg4.

Black decides to set up a solid system and attack white undefended king's pawn. To this extent he prepares the d5 push with e6 so he will not need to recapture with his queen after an eventual exd5. At the same time black opens a way for his dark-squares bishop who can now be developed along the a3-f8 diagonal. The obvious drawback of e6 is that the light-square bishop is now shut and black will have to solve the problem of its developement. It is also worth mentioning that white is trying to control d5 and f5, two squares in black half of the board, while black is not trying to put any pressure on white half. The path for the game is already clear: black will try to attack e4 with all his might using the d5 push and developing his knight to f6, while white will try to use his space advantage to gain the upper hand while fighting black aggression against e4 with moves such as Nc3 (or Nd2) and Bg5 which pins the Nf6 on the black queen."

Right now white is has a pawn in e4 which is fighting to control f5 and d5. In a way the d5 pawn is himself under attack and black is tying to his defense the e6-pawn and the queen. So long as white can maintain the status quo black has to be careful he doesn't lose d5. By trading exd5 white gives up the fight for the f5 square once and for all, releases the queen and e6 from their duties and solves the Bc8 development problem for black. In exchange for this he can stop worrying about the e4 pawn. In the end the bargain favours black who solves all his problems and equalizes. Pushing e5 has completely different strategical ideas: white gets rid of any problem with e4 and cramps black a little more. However black himself no longer needs to worry about his d5 pawn and can move onto the next target: the d4 pawn.

Yes Andesson plays it, so do Anand, Shirov, Bareev and many other super-GM. In my database I have about 5000 games with this position, but how is this relevant to you? If I were you I'd put MCO on the shelf and leave it there a couple of years. In the meantime I would concentrate on tactics. As we will see you did not lose this game because you were not able to exploit ""a slight advantage in space"". You lost this game because you missed what your opponent was doing and committed tactical errors. Solve tactical problems from books, magazines, the web, solve as many as you can. When you have solved all the ones you could find, solve them again, see if you remember the solution, or if you can anyway solve them faster than before. And then solve them again. You'll see that you drop pieces less frequently, and you notice your opponent errors more easily. Only then go back to an opening book (not MCO) and have a look at lines, or even better collect the games of someone who plays the line you want to learn and see what he does. Do not learn his moves by heart rather check what weaknesses he tries to exploit or defend."

The bishop is biting on granite from c4: either white manages to organize a quick d5 push, typically in conjunction with Qe2 to put extra pressure on e6, or the bishop has not much scope from c4. Also black will almost certainly castle king-side when the bishop would find a more agrressive role in d3. However why did you play Bc4? I know that the rules of chess say you have to move now, but why did you choose Bc4 in particular? What tasks ahd you in mind for the bishop there?

White could contest it but doesn't think to do it and panics when he realizes black can spoil his kingside pawns. In order to avoid doubling the f pawns he goes through a bit of tactics where both players don't play the best moves. Black misses a great chance to attack but manages to reach an endgame against the infamous isolated queen pawn. The endgame is quite hard to win, but white plays one move attacks and ends up worsening his position (he even leaves the IQP hanging but his opponent doesn't see it). In the end he commits a tactical blunder, loses a piece and the game with it. During the game you seem worried of doing things by the book, without really knowing why you are doing them. For example you played Bc4 but what is the bishop doing there? Ok it is not on d3 blocking the d-file for the queen, but there has to be a reason to put it there? Why not e2 for example? or b5? or g3 and Bg2? Or why move the bishop at all, maybe you could play Qd2 and castle queen-side. I am not saying that these were all good alternatives, but you need to know why you are making a move. You mention b6 surprised you, but you should have noticed that the Bc8 had to be developed and b7 was as good a square as any. Then you would have noticed the threat to double your pawns and maybe you could have come up with a way to stop it. Instead you played Qd3 that is pretty useless. You also missed a few tactical sequences which unlimately costed you the game. My advice again is to exercise your tactical abilities solving problems. Once you know how to find them in problems you will see them during the games as well. When this will happen you'll start noticing your opponent weaknesses and you'll start thinking how to place your pieces to exploit them. You'll also see what you leave for your opponent and be able to defend it. Moves like b6 will not surpise you anymore, and you won't leave the bishop en-prise in b5. It's not going to be easy and it won't happen tomorrow, but with a bit of effort it will happen. You can find me on FICS if you want to discuss the game online."

Annotator: You are to be commended for submitiing a game in which you lost; It would have been easy to fall for the temptation in sending in a winning game, but we typically learn more from - dang it - losing, as much as it hurts. (++ I took the liberty of looking at recent games played by you FICS to get a more accurate sense of your strengths and areas for improvement; This is what I like seeing: 1) You are playing slow games, and not speed games; fast games are fun but can lead to superficial thinking and sloppy play; 2) I can tell that you are taking your time on your moves; 3) I liked how you handled some endgames, and the aggressive play during some skirmishes. For areas on which to work, I note: 1) Tactics are needing improvement; Both you, and sometimes your opponents, are missing one and two move combos; Sometimes pieces are left en prise. Ways to improve this? Depending on the time and money you wish to spend, for books I recommend: book - Manual of Chess Combinations 1a & 1b by Ivanshenko; software - Chess Tactics for Beginners put out by Convetka); I hope you are not put off by the ""beginner's"" label, but I think the books/software recommendations are accurate, and there are follow up texts/software for intermediate and advanced. 2) The opening needs some study. A book I like, despite its age and its being in descriptive notation is Chess Openings Theory and Practice by Horowitz. The analysis is indeed dated, but lines are explained and many illustrative games are provided. The book can probably be found on www.abe.com. I am sure there are alternatives that are newer, but I would avoid books with endless columns and little explanation. I hope my input provides either/or instruction or entertainment.

Ne3 g6 39.Nd5 Bxd5 40.exd and the game should be drawn. It is not easy for White to find a plan to win.

Unfortunately this idea isn't playable now: 37.Nf5 (as in the game) a4 38.Nxd6 attacking the Bishop and then Nb5, and White will gradually improve his position, or even more simply bxa4 followed by Nb7-Nxc5. So g6 seems to be the only move, but there is a problem: 37.Nd5 threatens Nf6+ winning the Bishop, so Black can move either the King or the Bishop. Let's see some variants: 37.Nd5 Kg7 38.Nc7 Bd7 (attacking g4) 39.g5, and black hasn't enough time to find a counterplay, ex. ...Bg4 40. Ne8 and Nxd6, or 39...a5 40. Nb5 and the d6 pawn is lost (40...Bxb5 41.cxb and the pawn promotes). 37...Bc6 instead of Kg7 is simply met by Nc7 and Black will lose a pawn.

Using your pieces to their fullest will usually involve threatening or executing a tactic. I'd suggest you study and practice ways to fully utilize your pieces to both improve their general mobility and utility and to execute tactics. A related issue is deciding when and which pieces to trade or avoid trading. Getting rid of your opponent's best pieces is clearly related to which of them could do tactical damage to your position. Knowing which of your pieces needs to be kept on the board relates to which can do real tactical damage (from somewhere on the board) in the future. Playing computer programs will help you see weaknesses in your own position and the next step would be learning how to neutralize their attacks and then you'll want to know how to improve your own pieces to possibly generate tactical threats of your own.

The real reason they are being played is because the white player hopes the black player is not familiar with this line of play and will make errors. The best way to tackle gambits you're not familiar with is to grap the first pawn, and after that follow the standard opening ""rules"". You could also decline the gambit (here for instance with 2. ... e7e5) to play on safe, but that will give white some advantage in the centre. Whatever you do, never try to defend the pawn advantage when you are playing an unfamiliar gambit.

Your king was weakened earlier and it cost you later. You tried to attack when there was none (...Qh4). You attacked when you could (...f3) and it worked fairly well. You might have missed one or two chances to attack, but you were trying. You need to build up to your offensive more patiently and soundly, so I'd recommend you review some games from a database or off the Internet to see some plans of how that might be done. Look for games where Black wins with king-side play to get some examples and to see how he creates play even when White doesn't cooperate much. This endgame required it's own analysis and plan, so I'd recommend you clarify in your own mind exactly where the middle-game ends and the endgame begins and at that moment begin to execute an endgame strategy to win and promote pawns to make more material. This will often lead to pawn grabbing and king activity, but there will be much less (almost non-existent) chance for an attack on the enemy king -- until you get more queens and renew the attack in earnest."

White can complete his development in 3 moves ...1 Q move, 1 Bc1 move, Castles. The Rooks are then connected. Some would say 5 moves, because development is not achieved until the Rooks move, say to d1 and e1. It will take Black 4 moves to connect the Rooks. That is why 4...h6 is doubtful.

The N has just moved for the third time and when he goes off the board his tempi go too. The Bishop which goes off has moved only once. It's true that White has the 2 Bishops in an open position ... a definite advantage, but it's also true that he gets a potentially weak pawn on f5. Also, he has no pawns on the d or e files and cannot quickly challenge the black pawn which will arrive on d5.)"

This is my favourite variation when I rarely play against the sicilian (I am a 1.d4 fan!). Play is not that violent as in open variations. White develops calmly, g3 and Bg2, sometimes the f pawn is pushed in f4 followed by Nf3, aiming for a delayed or totally absent push in d4. It worths a check in"

The d6 pawn now is unprotected by pawns (and it won't be forever), is a clear target in an open file, a target for white rooks. Your cousin correctly didn't trade Knights because doing that would have significantly improved your pawn structure in the center.

Stil, I was already expecting one of the two white bishops to come out to the 5th. rank, just as it did. Pardon me, I do not agree with your optimistic evaluation. In this position White hasn't any weakness, Black does: the d6 pawn and the d5 square. White should have continued with Bg5, pinning the Knight, and after Be7 should have traded it with Bxf6, getting rid of the main d5 guardian. Now the c3 Knight has a wonderful outpost. No matter if Be6 threatens to trade it off: after any simplification of the position, the d6 weakness becomes more and moreimportant in the endgame."

Now that I review the game I think this plan is just wrong. That knight must never be allowed into the d5 outpost. The best try to keep the Knight away from d5 was to avoid the e5 push :-) Your d5 weaknes is what the classical books identify as a ""permanent weakness"".

Nxd5! Nc4 followed by Nb6. I was just so absort in getting rid of this bishop, that I didn't see the obvious. there's no need of any comment. You said all what was necessary to say about this move. I just add my two cents: assuming that the normal move would have been Be7, meeting Ng5 with a kingside castle, an interesting plan would have been Be6, trying to challenge White about the d5 control. No matter if White trades Bishops: the e6 pawn becomes the d6's best friend :-) (prepares the d5 push). Have a look to the following sample variations:"

Nevermind the bishop, it's dead (so I thought). So I defended f7 (or so I thought). Hard to keep calm after such a blunder! I perfectly understand you. Whenever I blunder I hardly find a way to complicate tasks for my opponent! Easier to find the way when relaxed, with a cup of coffee and a snack, in front of PC/chessboard. However, Qd7 defends nothing, as you correctly pointed out. Have a look to my variation. The d5 push would have brought the game to a very complex fight. I'm not sure everything is correct in my variation, but it is only an idea about how to behave in desperate positions. Normally there are two ways: 1-passive play, hope of an opponent's blunder (=myracle) 2-further sacs, aiming for complication. In both cases there are some practical chances of success. Definitely in case 2 games are more brilliant (and short :-)."

As a result, white is currently winning the minor piece imbalance. For pawn structure, up until now, neither side has had any potential weaknesses. Black's advance of e5 creates a potential backward pawn on d6. It's shielded (by the d4 pawn) but since the hole on d5 was black's big problem later in the game, this may not be the best move. For space (I use the Yasser Seirawan technique of ""count the squares in enemy territory you control, rather than overall squares""), both sides control 1 kingside. White has one central square and 2 queenside squares (compared to black having no central squares and 1 queenside square), so white is equal or ahead in space on all sides of the board. Material is equal. For important squares/files/etc, white has more of the center, and neither side seems to be vying for control of much else (the c file is open but currently uncontested), so white is a bit ahead here. For development, black is more developed on the kingside with respect to pieces that have moved, but white's dark bishop is influencing this sector without having moved, so I would consider this imbalance fairly equalized. Black may be considered to have temporary dynamic initiative due to the threat against d4 that e5 created."

OS : For most of the game, white was playing with most of the imbalances in his favor. Now, black has a point of extra material to play with. This comes at a structural cost in that the d6 pawn really IS backward now, since d4 is no longer a shielding pawn. Black's dark bishop is not yet solved, but he has a very nice knight on d4. The potential of this knight is dynamic rather than static, since white can exchange off for a knight or bishop quite easily. Ironically, the d4 knight is no longer actually controlling any queenside space, despite being farther advanced and being able to reach more squares in enemy territory. Both sides have about equal claim to the center at the moment, although black is making better use of it. White has a spatial edge on both kingside and queenside. Black may want to consider bringing a rook in to the fray with Rc8, partly because the d4 knight is helping to control this file, and black needs to do something to fight back against white's queenside edge while it's still small enough to contest."

With the chosen structure, white has to develop his remaining forces, grab all the space that's freely available, then sit on black for awhile preparing a breakthrough. -- death **"

My general comments are: (1) Black was better after the opening and you need something sharper. White should strive for the initiative with his first move advantage. I really think that opening with 1.e4 or 1.d4 is a good idea for a while. Flank openings can be tried later. (2) You got yourself back into the game well during the tactical phase of the game, say moves 13-25, and after 18...d3 you had good winning chances. However, you should have lost after 22.Re4. (3) If you are spending time studying chess, at least half of it (maybe more) should be on tactics. You can study tactical positions in books or there are computer programs like Ct-Art 3.0 from Convekta or Intensive Tactics from Chessbase (you don't need to have Chessbase to run this). After you've solved 50 positions on each of pins, forks and so on, you'll start to see them in your games! (4) Always look at every capture and check on every move, yours and your opponent's. Losing material almost always means defeat ...brilliant sacrifices are another matter! It's really hard to calculate several moves in advance and evaluate the positions, but there's no other way tp play and you will definitely improve with practice. (6) Always try to anlayse your games afterwards. Once you have done that, check it with a computer program (Fritz or Crafty or whatever) if you can to see what you've missed. But don't let the computer do it for you. You'll learn a lot by working out your own mistakes. (7) Always check analysis, including mine. I've tried to be careful but there may be mistakes here. No analysis is ever complete and can always be improved. Thanks for giving me the chance to look at your game. I really enjoyed it. Good luck with your chess.))"

The idea is to gain space on the queenside and to win a tempo by playing b2-b4 (attacking the bishop) and sometimes even to play b4-b5 (attacking the knight). The mainline is: 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.0-0 a5 ( to prevent 9.b4, not 8...Nge7?? 9.b4 wins a piece) and now 9. Nbd2, 9.a4 (to control b5, Na3-b5 is an idea) or 9.Qe2."

Your opponent didn't do much wrong, so perhaps you were unlucky in that regard. But you made the game very easy for him by dropping first a pawn and then a bishop early in the game. There is little point in analysing how the game goes once you are already down a piece. My two recommendations to you would be 1) check your ""automatic"" moves and make sure they don't lose in a simple tactical way. Here ...e5 is a typical opening move, but not when White has e5 so well covered. And e6 looked like the perfect square for your knight until you realised you had run your bishop out of squares. 2) Don't play aimlessly. It is difficult sometimes to have a plan. But even if you can't come up with a plan, try to improve your position somehow. Don't worsen your position attacking pawns your opponent can simply defend at no cost to himself. Good luck in the rest of your games!"

I think you're giving a bit too much credit to your opponent (in this game) and were expecting super-human tactics or something. But, on the other hand, you weren't giving him as much credit as you should for being sneaky and subtle. All in all you played well and deserved to win or at least draw. I think you could study the openings more or stop worrying about them and just play. Every opening which might even distantly be related to your repertoire might be helpful. In this game some knowledge of the Geller Variation and of the King's Indian Defense (in case of c2-c4) and of the Torre Attack would have been of some use. As far as planning goes you did pretty well, but it doesn't appear you considered a very broad range of possibilities and when you struck out with a plan you didn't stick to it for long. Perhaps worst of all was that he was playing you (not just your pieces) and you were playing superman and not just 'some guy'. This showed, I think, when you got enmeshed in the Nd6 pin problem and you didn't solve it very neatly. Maybe I'm over-stating this, perhaps it was just technical skill, but I could see what he was doing to not expose himself and to have options and then how he tried to take advantage. That he goofed up and lost his bishop showed clearly he was far from GM strength and was certainly human. I suggest: study openings some if you think it would help you, especially seeing how some openings develop in to certain kinds of middle-game plans. I suggest you study how to analyze variations better: anybody below master needs it. No wait, everybody below 2600 needs it. Mostly I suggest you study planning and coordination so you can develop better plans in your games despite a running clock and a strong opponent who glares at you for taking your time. This will develop more confidence and you'll more likely stick to your plans until your opponent really forces your hand. In a nutshell: study openings if you like, some variation analysis and MOSTLY planning in unusual positions. A lot of planning is imagining where you want all your pieces so they're safe, active, coordinated and so on. You don't always have to say, ""I go here, he goes there, I go here, he goes there."" You can say, ""Given a few free moves I'll go here, there, and even over there."" or maybe ""I'm gonna swarm that area of the board and put a knight here, a rook here and my queen there."" This one-sided thinking allows you more freedom to imagine new situations and yet stay within the bounds (pretty much) of the reality of how a piece can safely move in the midst of enemy forces. Getting caught up in only responding to the enemy is too limiting and destined for failure."

The f5 square which you are aiming for is a good place to go, but where is the backup? Also, as you correctly state, you have simply handed back the e5 square to Black, is it not better to restrict his pieces until you are ready to thrust forward? Kb1 is a good alternative, your king is safest there and covers the a-pawn but this needs to be combined with Nf3 which actually threatens h4 and gives some cover to e5.

White has the advantage of the bishop but Black has no clear weaknesses. Usually the plan in endings is to bring your king towards the centre from where it can start to act as an attacking piece. In addition each side also needs to look at entry squares into each other's position. Here Black should try to restrict the movement of White's knight by f6, but, he should also be careful not to put his pawns on dark squares so that the bishop can attack them. He also needs to improve the position of the knight on a5. For White centralising the king is important and I wonder whether it should be looking to drift over to c3 from where it can help the queenside pawns. the alternative is pushing the kingside pawns, that plan will certainly need the support of the king.

Before starting an attack get your rooks in play. Black would have done better if he had done this and not played d5 so early. 2. In the middlegame, don't exchange knights for bishops just because bishops are better in the long run. You had a better position before you exchanged on e7 then it became difficult for a while. 3. In endings make sure you position your pieces on their optimum squares. You did this well but did take sometime before finally... 4. Centralise your king in the ending. You did this in the end. Remember the king is an attacking piece in the ending. Well played and I hope you enjoyed the review."

rn1qk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/Pb4bP/2P5/3PPP2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,b4c5,I would play Be7 or possibly Bd6 here. While you keep your bishop in the center white has d4 here which would allow him to take back some control in the center
rn1qk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2bpp3/P5bP/2P5/3PPPB1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,c7c6,While this strengthens the d5 square the same thing could be accomplished with Ne7 or Nf6 developping the knight and preparing to castle kingside at the same time. In the opening it is very important to develop all your pieces as quickly as possible.
rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p5/2bpp3/P5bP/2P5/1B1PPPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,g4f5,Black allows e4 allowing white to take a bite out of the center. While arguably it is a slight improvement for black he would do much better to develop his g8 knight. I also just spoted Qb6 looks decent too but d4 would put a stop to this idea.

At some point during the opening it is often a good idea to plan out where you would like your pieces to be. Knights generally are more effective farther up the board making moves like Nf6 and Nc6 more popular. If one of the pawns were not moved and a knight put in its place black would look much more menacing.

Moving the king out of the way would leave black in a very good position since he can push the c pawn and simultaneously attack white's queen and the pawn on f2

r2q1rk1/4nn1p/1b2B3/p5pP/2pPp3/B3P3/1Q3PN1/RN3KR1 b - - 0 25,d8d6,A good move on first sight. This gives away the queen for nothing since it hangs to the a3 bishop (black can't even get back the bishop since his knight is pinned.

Black could get a free queen with Nxe3+! since white's knight no longer protects the e3 square and the f2 pawn is pinned.

He didn't hang any pieces but he made many mistakes. He left his queen in a deadly fork which I pointed out. The key points you need to work on (other than not hanging your pieces!) is pins and development. To try and prevent hanging pieces pause for 5 or 10 seconds before making any move. Read about one opening (I like the italian game myself) and understand it. You must develop your entire army. You did a slightly better job than your opponent but the pieces didn't seem coordinated and black lost many oppertunities to develop faster. White's play is actually more deplorable. His knight on b1 never moved and it was only in the last four moves that his a1 rook did anything. I don't know about other people but I tend to consider these important pieces and they did nothing at all for white. Try and set your rooks on open files. The b file was begging for a black rook On b8 the whole game. Try and only make 2 or 3 pawn moves before you have all your pieces developped and have castled. DO NOT move the pawns in front of your king unless you find it an important defensive move. It's kind of like abandoning your mother in a bad neighbourhood late at night :) Try and place your rooks and bishops in positions where they point at the king or queen, especially when there are pieces blocking them. Who knows when these pieces might come flying off the board or when your opponent might feel the need to move them. Make a plan. There's a saying in chess; if you don't plan you plan to fail (well not only chess I suppose but what else really matters?."

Nf4 is positionally reasonable only with the idea Nd5. 5) You can't ""not completely"" see a tactic.

If you are still at the level where you regularly hang pieces, you are to be congratulated for spending 21 moves without a blunder of this sort. However if you have moved past this level, you played this game very poorly almost from the beginning, with occasional flashes of competence. You played passively in the opening, worried about non-existent threats from Black, opened the game too late and ultimately to your disadvantage. Although you were able to speak knowingly of moves as ""too passive"", ""prophylactic play"" and ""open diagonals"" you showed in your moves little understanding of these concepts or willing to put them into practice. Perhaps the best advice I can give you is to ignore all these ""advanced"" concepts you have learnt and focus on playing actively from move one, getting all your pieces to work and always striving for an active plan.

The problem with the exchange variation is that you solve Black's problem over the c8 bishop and he should find no trouble in equalising as he would in other French lines. Your choice of Nc3 is fine as would Nd2 have been, but I think that e5 is the best move to play as I hate facing it.

My endgame isn't so weak but am I supposed to be able to tell if this position is won/loss/ draw? How do I stop making weak moves like the f4 move here, and how do I increase my awarness of tactical shots by my opponents. When I played 7 months ago, I never faced this problem but now since I came back it won't leave me alone. How do you suppose for me to develop an opening repertoire, should that be a first priority to me? Or should tactics/positional play be.

Why do you think I should improve my chess in that way? How is my tactical play, did I avoid any tactical shots or did I miss some? Is my positional play good, or bad and why?

It is important to have favourite lines against all of Black's main responses to e4 or d4 and to learn them. In this game Bd2 is not a 'main' line, but that does not matter if the player is familiar with the plans, so a good opening repertoire is essential and a good reference book is too. There is never a good substitute to good practice so if you have been away from the game for a while you will miss things, but this will return. get yourself a good tactics book and studies book and work on some problems each day (and try not to cheat by looking at the answers before you have fully solved each one!!) this will help a lot. As far as this game goes neither of you missed a lot, in fact I would say that Black did not really try anything in this game, he just won the pawn you gave him and swapped off into a won ending. If you look at the lines I have presented then you should be able to see the possibilities you had in the game. As far as being able to tell whether the position was ultimately a drawn position or not is really down to a number of factors. In this game the opposite coloured bishops and the fact that your king was better placed in the ending was a clue to you having drawing chances, but once Black had mobilised his kingside pawns he strated to become better. After f4 of course the game was lost and he was not really tested to prove he was actually better. I hope you enjoy the review and keep on with the practice."

However, there are plenty of games in which one side allow the other to create the two isolated pawns in c5 and d5 (or c4 and d4 for White). If you were aiming to this structure the move 10...b6 fits very well. It's a matter of taste, two proud pawns versus open lines.

I was planning to develop the black-squared bishop to b2 and I couldn't find any role for my Queen - it would fall under attack on a4, h4, or even on c2. So getting rid of this troublesome piece seemed logical. Now, however, I think that sequence a2-a3, b2-b4, Bc1-b2 and Qd1-b3 (or c2) was better than this exchange, as after the text I was faced with some trouble with weak d2. During the game, I could not decide whether the correct way to place the queenside pawns was a2, b3 or a3, b4 (assuming that the bishop was to be developed on b2) ; the latter would have prevented black playing b7-b5-b4 but enabled a6-a5, leaving white with weak b-pawn instead.

Time to give up. MH: Your notes reflect perfectly the kind of talk I've heard from 1700 players. Your thinking is a bit scattered. Your position assessments are sometimes good, but often terribly wrong. You struggle to find your way through a maze of variations and surprise moves when a stronger player sees simplicity. I suggest you do your position assessments more carefully and try to get a very clear idea of what you want to do with the position. Only then check variations and tactical shots. Choose your move or the move-sequence carefully, but have faith in your idea. In this game your handling of the early position (after 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c5) is indicative of this confusion and lack of order in your approach. Recollect how you faced that position. Did you think Black's move was a mistake? A bluff? A good move? Did you try to refute it or just let it go unnoticed? This initial feeling about a position determines a lot of how you handle it. Recollect how you felt about the position after the queen trade. Did you feel confident it was only a matter of technique to win or did you have great doubt about whether White was better? How about after Bc1-b2? Could you not feel White was clearly better? How did those feelings inspire you to choose this or that plan? Position assessment has to be accurate to lead you to the right idea (to play next). Recollect what you thought about the position when you played g2-g3? How many different moves or ways of mobilizing the king-side did you consider? Having a good idea also requires you to carry it out (execute it) effectively. You were a little weak on piece activity: when you played h2-h3 and neglected Bc1 and Ra1. As you assess positions you should consider piece activity a bit more important.

Holzi: I'm not so sure this was wrong, after all finally black also gets a weakness, even if he gets the f-file for it.

Trading the rooks would help you, especially since your rook is currently totally inactive, his rook is quite strong and his knight have slight problems with finding good outposts - however there are several problems with Rf1, firstly the unprotected pawn on h3 (the pawn by itself might not be decisive, but black would getting two free pawns on the h and g-file, which could be very dangerous) and secondly (something your opponent missed later in the game) the check Nf4-d3+ leaving your rook en prise.

You certainly haven't lost this game, because your opponent played much better than you, but rather because he played reasonably well and eventually you made the decisive error blundering the bishop. Black gave up his dark squared bishop up to weaken the white pawn structure, but in compensation white had his two bishops. While those weren't always especially strong, they eventually totally dominated the knights in the endgame (one of the risks black had to accept when playing Bxc3) . It is very difficult to tell, where exactly black got into a losing position - certainly from a practical point of view white already had excellent chances after black took the pawn on h3. When one looks at the opening, both sides committed several small inaccuracies and there was the big chance for you on move 17, but in the end it just added up to a small advantage for black. Nothing really decisive had happened until you gave away the g2 pawn for free. Except for the occasional tactical slip (like 32.Rf1?) and missing the occasional tactical chance for yourself (17.Nxe6!) you played the game quite well, usually you seemed to have a good idea of what you should do strategically, but sometimes you didn't seem to be watching your opponents options closely enough. A lot of strong players think that one of the things resulting in a great improvement in playing strength is analysing tactical positions on your own (writing down the variations etc.) and then comparing the results with the annotations of strong players. That way one hopefully learns to consider all options of both sides and to assess very clearly which plans can be carried out tactically. I hope my review helps."

Also, consider wher you want to place your pieces. f5 is an inviting square for your knight(s), after Nc3-e2-g3 and Nf3-d2-f1-e3. Also, the white king bishop is unhappy with so many of the white pawns on white squares. So instead of Qd2, wite could consider trading it off with Bc4-e2-g4, after moving the king knight.

Killerman: I agree with some of your comment but not all. Firstly, I would not take the the exchange on d6 as after 6 Bxd6 cxd6 the e5 square is not available for the knight. Furthermore Black has an extra pawn in the centre and may get the opportunity to play e5 at a convenient time to free his position.

The pawn centre did not need resolving when you played cxd5 as if Black had captured on c4 you would have been OK so why did you decided to do it? You had already recognised that after c4 dxc4 you would have played Bxc4 so why the change of plan? I suspect because it was not easy to see a better one and I agree it isn't an easy position to play. Finally, as with many closed openings like this they lead to a very slow developing type of game which I admit is not to my taste.

The immediate sac in h7 gives nothing, but... shoul black play carelessly, how about a white queen in h5? :-) Black had to take some countermeasures. The push in ""f5"" closes the diagonal for a while, but has the drawback of some holes creation in the King's defence (e5 and g5). This is the way veterans play: with some threats, they force the opponent to create weaknesses, hoping to take advantage from that.

The main lines suggested by opening books are precise enough to assure you of an even position. As on the 4th move, dxc6 is the book move and better it is than bxc6. Second, drop some prejudice on position evaluation. I guess it was your fear of weakening the kingside that caused your miss of playing g5 on 12th move and Qc8 13th move, in fact they are playable since it is long before white can mass pieces over the weakened field. Third, check the practicability of a move before making it. This can help avoid implementing strange ideas like 18...a5?? and making blunders like 21...Qe7??. Above all, the more practice the better.

Black does not score particularly well with a6, but it is by no means a losing move. So why is it that players prefer to avoid it? Black is pretty much offering a Ruy-Lopez Exchange where the moves Nc3 and Nf6 have been played. In the Ruy-Lopez Exchange after Bxc6 dxc6 white cannot capture in e5 as Nxe5 Qd4 Nf3 Qxe4 gives black a good game. In our case Qd4 has to be preceeded by Nxe4 Nxe4 when, after Qd4, white has the time to castle therefore retaining a good position."

However at club level games are rarely won in the opening, and one needs not worrying about them too much. If one just takes this game as an example, both black and white make several judgment and planning errors in the opening, then both make a few tactical miscalculations and white wins pretty much because it is black that makes the last error. At our level it is far more useful to concetrate on tactics than study countless opening books, so I strongly reccomend solving tactical puzzles, the more one solves the more acute his tactical skills will become. With time two-moves combinations will become easier to see, then three-moves and so on. With constant practice one can be able to eliminate bluders from his game. This is far more helpful than knowing that a line is +/= after 17 moves, especially if one has no idea what to do on move 18.

It is also worth nothing that after the trade white has again the c3 and d4 plan available, after a few preparatory moves like 0-0 and Re1.

Moreover from e7 the knight can hop to g6 to provide help in any action on the king-side. 5) You offer the possibility of Nxb4, see the note to the next move.

Both are still undeveloped: white needs to put the king to safety before taking any action in the center or his majesty can end up in big troubles. His dark-square bishop needs to find a new home, but it is not quite clear where that is. It may go to e3, but that would make a d4-push more difficult since the e4-pawn can no longer be defended by a rook in e1. So should it instead go to d2? but then what would it do there? We can't put a piece on a random square and call it developed. Maybe it is a good idea to wait a little to decide. On the plus side white has a very solid center and and he just needs a couple of moves to be able to break with d4. Black king instead is absolutely safe, but the e5 pawn is a bit shaky. If white can organize d4 exd4 cxd4 black can be in troubles. The light-squares bishop is to be developed as well: a possibility can be then d6 (which incidentally supports e5) and then decide for a square on the c8-h3 diagonal. Another plan may involve Bb7 and Re8 to answer to a d4-push with exd4 uncovering an attack one e4. In the end the whole game revolves around white wanting to play d4 and black wanting to keep the push inoffensive. To this aim Be3 seems premature, while it supports d4, it also makes the Bb7, Re8 plan more effective."

True the bishop sits behind two of his own pawns, but it is not useless there. First of all it provides a support to the e4-pawn when d4 is finally played, second it is aimed at black king-side. Maybe it is time to stop a moment to discuss this d4-push and why it is so important. White dream goal is to play d4, force black to take exd4 and take back with cxd4, and then manage to roll the two pawns kicking away the black pieces from the 6th rank, and gaining space for an attack on either side. Black of course doesn't want to hear any of that and he will try to stop with any possible means. He can for example control the d4 square with as many pieces as possible, starting with the Nc6, but also bringing the bishop to f6. He can also attack the Nf3 that controls d4, typically with Bg4 (that's why h3 at some point is so commen in the Ruy-Lopez). His other option is to attack e4, white main weakness, hoping to divert enough white forces to that task to make d4 impossible. To attack e4 black can play the light-square bishop to b7 and the rook to e8, and of course a knight to f6. A third option is to allow d4 exd4 cxd4 and then attack white center with c5, d5 or f5. The majority of Ruy-Lopez follow either of the three plans or a mixture of them. Such a volatile situation also means that tactics of all sort are always present and one has to be wary of that. It is also worth to remember that after the d4 push white can try to continue with f4 opening the f-file and the b1-h7 diagonal on te black king. Many a Ruy-Lopez have been decided by the Bc2 coming alive after a d4/f4 push. Supporting your center with d6, or developing a counter-attack against e4 with Bb7 and Re8 would have been a good choice. However your idea is not wrong at all since after Bc2 black can take advantage of the white king and strike in the center with d5. It is clear now that Be3 was an error and castling should have been played instead."

MAd: If you do not remove the queen from d8 any d5 push will most likely end in a heavy pieces trade along the d-file and and even endgame. Moreover it is a good idea to occupy the file with a rook before opening it so the queen move seems to make sense. However you forgot that white can open it too, especially since he is already occupying it with his queen and rook, and we will see this next move. You hit the right spot: e5 might be weak when things open up, but rather than defending it with Qc7, you might have attacked one of its attackers."

Nh4 will always be answered by Bxh4 when white pawns are horrible. All g3 does is weaken the knight and the white squares around the king. White misses his chance to take control of the d-file as mentioned before."

So far white had to prove that he can push the d-pawn. You have no other weakness he can exploit so it is a complicated task facing him. Now you let him win a second pawn, gaining a lot more options as you have to be wary of that one as well."

3k4/8/3K4/5Q2/P7/8/7P/8 w - - 11 64,f5f8,"Some final comments to the game. It seems to me you missed the min features of the game, in particular that white tries to push d4 and black has to do something about it. In itself this is not horrible, we are all bad players and fail to grasp the basics of a position, however it seems to me you spend the first 10-15 moves wanderig around with your knight without a clear aim, at most with one-move threats like playing Na5 to trade knight for bishop. That Na5 was also meeting the requirements of the position is a typical example of serendipity. Again though you moved the Be6 because it was wit hgain of time, without worrying if e6 was the right square for the bishop. At this point you decided to push d5, probably because you had the bishop in e6 anyway. What I mean is that you did not play Be6 because you wanted to support a d5 push, but you decided on a d5 push because the bishop happened to be there. Here you got worried of Bg5 and a couple of moves later failed to notice white could open the d-file with a complicated position. A few blunders on both sides meant you ended up allowing a passed pawn rather than being an exchange up, and you got scared of it and played passively missing a good chance to achieve a draw and making it easier for white than it should have been. In the end white managed to convert the pawn endgame and won. This is the description of the typical game between club players: the only difference between a 1400 and 1800 is that the 1800 makes a litte less blunders and plans a little more. This is where you should concentrate your efforts: start by making sure you no longer miss winning the exchange like you did. That you tactical skills need a bit of effort is also shown by your notes: you thought you would win a piece while you were only winning an exchange. Solve problems from magazines and books, when you have finished go back to them again and check if you solved them faster than the first time. Then do it again. Your tactical senses will be more awake during games and you'll win the exchange without even thinking about it. When your tactics starts improving have a look at games on the openings you play: pick a good player that plays one of your lines and look at what he does, don;t learn his moves by heart but try to figure out what he is trying to do, what weaknesses in the opponent he tries to exploit, which ones in his position he tries to defend. I strongly suggest you pick classic openings like the Ruy-Lopez or the Queen Gambit Declined, they are best to learn about developemnt, piece coordination etc... Anyone who plays traps and sidelines can gain a few rating points fast but the he stops. But most of all do not get discouraged by losing, you learn a lot more and improve a lot more by losing to a better player than by trashing a weaker one.

White has cleverly chosen the move 3.c3, which leads to a kind of Alapin variation where White has an extra tempo because he already has a knight on f3, while I have wasted a turn playing a6. I know this move to be the best reply from the 50 000 game database of ChessMaster 7000. Compare the following (which are master level or above games) 3.c3 132-100-67 (White scores an average of 0.61 points +/-) 3.c4 52-34-48 (White scores an average of 0.51 points, =) 3.d4 31-39-60 (White scores an average of 0.36 points, -/+) 3.Nc3 14-11-12 (White scores an average of 0.53 points, +/=) He hasn't played d4, so its time to play some good moves. Killerman: I agree White is going to achieve a better position potentially than Black. As we shall see White develops to an Advanced French position where the move a6 is of no real help. You appear to recognise the weakness of this set up so it is important to remember that when faced with such a prospect you must try to get something going in the position to compensate for this. Your development is key and I believe you now make some bad choices."

On the other hand, my king looks quite poorly guarded from White's point of view. I figure that one knight moving to g7 would be enough to guard the king against any onslaught, was this a bad decision? Should I have made further measures to ensure his protection? Killerman: Let us look at the respective positions and see where the problems lie. White has good development as well as a space advantage a kingside attack is bound to come soon. Black has many development problems. Not castled (danger maybe in doing so), bad bishops, lack of space. In this type of position if black just sits back he will get squashed, so it is important to find something dynamic to do. trouble is finding the move."

I distrust the line for Black as it looks too passive to me after c3 and d4 for White. However you did appear to handle this well albeit should have lost after 0-0. My tip in this game would be to look at the Bc6 move that you played and say why? , because I think that if you wish to pressure the queenside you need to get rid of the rook. You will also have the advantage of the two bishops if you can get the position to open up. Bc6 and the subsequent Qa4 eventually caused the loss although time pressure probably was a factor by then.

Much more important is that the resulting positions of the opening match with your style. You have to feel comfortable in the positions, for example if you dont like sharp positions you shouldnt play the Kings gambit. Perhaps you should check your performance: Have a look at your played games and check if you score well in sharp positions or did you win more games with quiet, positional play? If you score better in sharp positions you should consider to chose a different opening. But back to the game. I have played this position a couple of times myself.

I can always castle on the queenside if needed to. ACA: Your move seems good enough. But Bg6 also seems viable. But instead of capturing with the h pawn, I would opt for capturing with the f pawn. This followed by the move ... e5, after protecting the d5 pawn with c6, gives you enough counter play in the center. Capturing with the h pawn followed by queenside castling doesnt seem good.

Should i have doubled my rooks on the e-file and put more pressure on the backward e-pawn? or should i have play to expand in the queenside and try to increase my space advantage? Well, you tell me. ACA: All your pieces are placed for a king side attack, so a qeen side attack with the help of your pawns doesnt seem right.

White made no great blunders in the rest of the game, but he was never able to recover from the early setback. A human opponent might make a tactical error to allow you back in the game, but computers never do! My advice (I wish I could always follow it myself!) would be: Don't lose material ...one pawn down is usually enough to lose against someone who knows what he's doing. In the opening, concentrate on getting a fair share of control or occupation of the centre. Remember that we (or the opponent) can attack pawns and pieces, but also squares. Squares can be strong or weak, and if they are centre squares that is vitally important. Sometimes an entire game can rest on control of a single square. In the Sicilian, for instance, the game often hinges on control of d5. So, in the opening, concentrate on: King safety Control of centre Piece development Black's attack worked because he had positional superiortiy. Tactics are always available in that situation. If there had been no available attack, Black could have won by swapping off the pieces and his 4-3 pawn majority on the queenside would have done the trick."

The first factor is the centre and if you look at the pawn structure it is clear that if Black is to attack White's centre it is by playing c5, it is the most natural pawn break. In addition the pawns on e6 and d5 suggest a queenside attack as they point in that direction. The second consideration is development. Are there any natural moves that I can consider playing? Well, Nf6 has to be a candidate move but neither bishop has a really 'good' square and I would suggest that the queens knight falls into the same category. The third factor is castling. Which side shall I go? Well, if I have decided in the first place that I am attacking on the queenside it is reasonable to suggest that the kingside is where I will castle. In conclusion then I am castling kingside and playing Nf6 and c5. Either of the two moves is fine and I give a couple of sample lines.

JK: Now you see why I didn't like 4. Be3. It doesn't do anything there and you have to move it a second time (to f4) to make it work. By the way, there is no need to act since e5 is attacked twice (Nc6/Pd6) and covered twice (Nf3/d4), so it is stable.

However, both sides need to be careful. The key to playing endgames is activity. As the board opens out each piece needs to be on it's optimum square. Pawn structure needs to be good and when bishops are around you have to be selective about the colour squares that the pawns are on. Lastly, the king. It is essential that his majesty is used and as it is unlikely, with few pieces on the board, that your king can get mated there he needs to be moving towards the middle of the board."

White held a good position but did not use the rooks to best advantage be aware of this as it is a failing in many players who start attacking before developing all their pieces. Once into the ending your king is an attacking piece so it must centralise. Activity is the key part of the endgame so if you get tempted to play defensive moves look again. In this case the ending was I believe drawn all the way through until your blunder on move 46. An enjoyable game to look through and I hope that I have given you some ideas. I would recommend that you perhaps get an endings book my favorite is by Paul Keres called Practical Chess Endings which is full of theory. There is also a very good book called Endgame Magic published by Batsford which is quite excellent.

In this case black was threatening nothing (exd4 could have met by Qxd4! - the e5 square is under White control). 3) In closed positions one or two tempo doesn't make a relevant difference; in open position they do! Black moves like Qe7 and h6 could have been punished effectively with a fluid center. Did you consider 6....., c5 as an answer to your push in d5?

So i decidet to try it out, altough i just didn't beleve it will work agains such a strong opponent, and that i'll just overextende my attack at some point and die...Killerman: I have to agree that this is the plan but I prefer playing 0-0-0 first to connect the rooks. I do not see that this will slow you down as the position is blocked until you make the break. If there is one thing to learn here it is to attack at the right time and when the pieces are in the right position. If you attack too soon you find that you have to waste a move later on to complete development and that is just enough for the opponent to cover the attack. As computers do not shuffle pieces well I would have looked to manouvre first and then play g4. As it happens you get a very good position playing it your way. Silman's books are excellent and I would also recommend 'How to Reassess Your Chess' as another good read."

Black has a sound if cramped defensive position and the key piece here has to be the g7 bishop which covers the key h6 pawn. Doubling rooks on the h-file looks attractive but where is the breakthrough coming from? I think e4 is a good idea too but would prepare it first with Rde1. Another interesting idea is Nh5! threatening to get rid of the g7 bishop liquidates the position and White ends up slightly better."

Please let me know what I can do to improve my play."" bscastro: ""Here are some recommendations based on this game. First, think about how long your plans take. Earlier in this game, you mentioned a plan of putting your light-square bishop on b3 or c2. Ask yourself while you're playing, what is my bishop doing here? Is there a better place for my bishop? If you're plan was to attack the d5 pawn, ask yourself, how easy can my opponent defend against my attack. These types of questions will help you develop a plan when playing. Secondly, tactics, tactics, tactics! Your opponent made many mistakes, so you were okay, but every player under master level should study tactics intensely. Third, here are some general guidelines for planning when you are ahead in material: 1) Continue to attack weak points in your opponent's position-e.g. weak pawns, pinned pieces, etc. 2) Exchange pieces (if you do #1 correctly, this will be easier, because you can exchange if your opponent tries to defend his pawns or pieces. 3) Stop your opponent's counterplay--e.g. If your opponent has a dangerous passed pawn, give some material back to stop their threats (for example, sacrifice a piece if you are way ahead to stop the pawn). 4) Always be on alert of surprises-e.g. losing your queen or getting checkmated. Finally, to improve your game overall and your planning, study games of stronger players and try to decide what plans they were making. Cover up the moves of the game and see if you can figure out what plan should be followed and then see what plan they actually did. This is best done with annotated games which there are plenty of on the web for free. Good players to do this with are positional players like Capablanca or Karpov, but attacking players like Morphy or Tal are good too because you can see how they build up an attack (not just making one move threats). Oh, and study those tactics! Good luck and I hope this will be helpful to you."""

There are three things you could do aboutit: break open the centre so it gets more freedom, move it outside the pawn chain, or trade it off. Moving it to a4 doesn't look very promising, and slow. Moving it to g4 also takes a lot of preparation because it needs too much protection, so let's ignore that. Let's look at the overall plan first. On the queenside, we have a half open line, but also doubled pawns. Black has no weaknesses. If we put pressure on the b file, we might eventually provoke b7-b6, then move a4-a5xb6 to create a weak pawn, and pressure it, but it's a very slow plan, and even if it all works, it's not hard for black to defend a pawn on b6.The center is currently locked up. The break f2-f4 is the only way to try to open it, but Black isn't forced to take on f4. However if he moves, say,f4 Re8 fxe5 dxe5, we get a supported passed pawn on d5 that is a trump in the endgame.If he does take, or retakes with a piece on e5, the e pawn becomes mobile and the d3 bishop and c2 queen would become active. This should look promising. On the kingside there isn't much to do yet. His king is there, but ours will also probably go there. An immediate pawn storm doesn't seem to have much chance as Black has no weakness and our bishop and queen are out of play a bit.In total, I'd go for Bd3, with the idea of f2-f4 (the knight moves to f5, if possible - if Black takes, our e-pawn restrict the pieces a bit less already)."

If the black take in f3, I could keep the king in the centre, where I don' t think it is in danger (the centre is close), and try to attack the king side with Tg1, Bg5, Dd2 and f4. But I didn' t want loss to opportunity of the short castle, so I played 11.Nd2. Besides after the game the opponent told me he didn' t take in f3. Was 11.Be3 or 11.Be5 better?E: The better move is 11.Nh4! f3-h4-f5 is a faster route than f3-d2-f1-g3-f5, and doesn't block the bishop on c1.Nf5 and f4 are coming up, and probably 0-0 to get the rook on the soon to be opened f-file. If black tries to prevent Nf5 with the weakening 11.Nh4 g6, white simply plays 12.0-0 with f4-f5 coming, black can't even play Nbd7since f3 locks up the black bishop."

I could try to increase thebressure on the b line with o-o, a4, Ba3, Tfb1 and a5. If the black pushed the pawn to b6 and took in a5, I could play against the weak pawns on the aline. During the game I thougt this plan take too many moves. Besides the bishop in a3 will be causig holdup, so I will have to spend another move tobring it in c1. So I decide for an attack to the king side, but the Tb5 wasout of play. Besides the queen from c7 in the game will defend effectively the seventh line.E: This move (and the previous one) is only good if you are going to play for the queenside plan. Even if you are, 0-0 also fits in with that plan and keeps more options open.The whole plan is of course quite slow. But you should have noticed that a few moves ago when you had to choose a plan, not a few moves into it!Note, by the way, that all black's pieces are on nice-looking squares, but he has no good plan, as far as I can see. All the active things he can go for (b7-b5, f7-f5, exchanging the white bishop) relieve you of some of yourproblems. Still, he had to choose a plan, and not move around aimlessly theway he's going to do. He could go for his own kingside attack, with Qd8 now, then Nh5-f4 and f7-f5 (if e4xf5, then Nxd3 before taking back).

Study master games to see the ideas of the openings. Queen's pawn openings are different that king's pawn openings in nature, so the ideas will be different. One good book if you have access to it is Logical Chess: Move by Move by Irving Chernev. It's an excellent move-by-move account of early masters and explains the plans behind every move very well. 2. When you have a chance to win material and it is not a trap, win the material first. Your opponents luckily have given you second chances, but stronger opponents won't. 3. When you are ahead in material, make sure your king is safe and develop your pieces so you can use your extra material. Also, feel free to trade down material so that your extra material will become an even bigger factor. 4. Play stronger opponents who will punish you for your mistakes. I've found through many losses that I've improved much more from losing against strong opponents than I have against winning against much weaker opponents. Good luck!"

Among recommendations to improve is to study games played by masters. You can get an idea about how they ""string"" moves together into plans and why they make the moves they do. A good book which explains each move made in master games is Chernev's Logical Chess Move-by-Move. If you want to improve, I would highly recommend this book. In general, here are some other pieces of advice: 1. Before you make a move, ask yourself, ""Can any of my pieces be taken? Can he put me in check and does that matter? What is the purpose of my move?"" These questions will help you avoid simple errors in your games. 2. Try to have your pieces work together. For example, if you are attacking the king, make sure you use several pieces, not just one or two. This takes advanced planning, and you will get better at it the more you do it. 3. When possible, try to play stronger competition who will punish you for your mistakes. It is one of the fastest ways to improve (many losses have taught me this). 4. You had some knowledge of tactical devices such as discovered attacks and forks. Continue to study these profusely. Good luck."

You also want to improve your knight on a6, and your other pieces need something to do. Without the queens, your king is quite safe without castling, and the rook on a8 might be useful there later. I suggest Nb4!? to make use of the weak point on c2, push ...c5 later so the knight can go to c6. The bishop is useful on f8 to support pawn c5 and to cover d6 in case of Nb5-d6. (see variation)."

The game got off to a very quiet start, after some fifteen moves there had been no real confrontation, only quiet development moves and piece exchanges. Neither player seemed to know what to do. Then there was a short phase of about 10 moves of tactics - and with some big errors by both players. He gives a pawn away, then another, but you don't take it and give yours away. The mistakes made there were much bigger than anything else that happened in the game, except for the brief moment in the endgame with d5?? Kc7??. Now, all of these things were quite simple tactics - I know you can understand these things, and certainly you must know that you could get better at it with practice. The strategy is much harder - what's a good plan for black after move 10? I'm not sure. I gave one idea, but this is much harder, more subtle. AND: even if your strategy is as good as Karpov's, if you drop pawns or fail to win dropped pawns, it is useless. Conversely, do you see how many simple mistakes this player 250 points above you makes? Believe me, they also do it 500 points higher. The conclusion then is: get better at tactics. It's no use at all to learn openings or endgame strategy when you make big basic tactical mistakes. There is a simple way to learn tactics: practice. Solve diagrams with pins, skewers, forks etc from puzzle books, but also try to get into tactical situations in every game. You might lose more at first, but since you would do it every game, you'd soon improve a lot. Then we get to my last point: the Caro Kann is a very bad opening for this. It is a very strategical opening, good for masters who play for a draw as black, but it gives all the tactical opportunities to white in most lines, if black misses something; and in other lines like this one it leads to very saltless positions where you don't know what you should do. I suggest you play ....e5 in answer to 1.e4, since it often leads to positions where both players have something clear to do. And learn the basics - tactics, and the fight for the centre, something else that was almost entirely absent from this game. This advice is a bit of a cliche, but the proof is in your game - the first 15 moves had no influence on the result at all, and weren't very exciting either. You learn nothing from that part. Then a part that was understandable for lower players, but where both of you showed you can improve a lot there, and then a hard endgame. Take up the Caro Kann again when you are close to master level :-). And too bad you didn't win it, you were winning a few times. And now it's time for bed. Success."

It's clear, I think, that Black can keep the tension with 22....Qh6 or 22...Qe7. But if we look closer at the position, we can say some interesting considerations: a) if we compare the both kings, the white one is more secure. b) Black has a better activity with his pieces. c) The pawn structure is favourable to White: d6 can become weak. d) Black has a powerful Bishop, but White has beautiful centralized Knight. It seems to me that Black has NOW the initiative. But if he doesn't succeed in attacking the king, White will become very dangerous later. So taking the draw here is not bad decision I think."

Killerman: I agree that you have set up a standard position here and you should get a good game. I tend to favour a slightly different set up by playing on move 7 f4 to counter the fact that if the bishop goes to b7 you can in many lines play Bf3 to support the centre and counter the action of the bishop. It also helps to stop Black's freeing move d5. Black's move b6 is actually a little premature. I believe that your opponent should be playing Nc6 first. The weakness of the move b6 will become apparent as we move on. In addition the move Bb7 is usually prepared by a6 and b5, I will come back to this later on as well."

If the c2 pawn were on c4, white would feel much more satisfied: he can play Rc1, or Qc2 followed by Rad1, to support his center. So I planned to move the c3 knight away then c2-c4, and 11.a3 is logical. Killerman: Your position is not actually as bad as the picture you paint. I agree if there was a pawn on c4 you would perhaps have a better position but to actually spend time getting it there is going to take too long. I mentioned earlier about the set up by Black of a6 and b5. Why does Black normally do this and not simply play b6? Well one of the reasons is that it is a stronger set up. Here you can actually take advantage of the fact that the bishop on b7 is supporting the knight. If you delay Black will play Rc8 and his weakness will have gone. I also think that if you don't take this opportunity the position starts to favour Black."

Another way to support the c2 pawn would be by playing Bd3 after capturing on c6. You could then consider moves like Qe2 or Rf2 which will support the c pawn. Rc1 is just too passive a move."

As a result Black equalized the game after his 11th move. Look at your moves 9-11 two pawn moves and Kh1. Sometimes it will be necessary to play these moves but all are quiet and passive. I believe that by playing a little more actively you will get a better game. Not seeing the strength of moves like Bc5 happens to us all but these possibilities may have not occurred if it had been you who was the active player. Even given the above you could have had a great battle after my line 14 Qa4 or even if you had played 19 Rfd1 the ending would not have been easy for Black to prove the win.

8/7p/2p1k1p1/2Pp1p2/4PP2/4P3/6KP/8 b - - 0 31,d5e4,As you rightly point out at the start the problem really stems from the passive e3. I think you need to ask yourself questions as you start off each game with the opening few moves. Make sure that each move has a purpose and try to keep to the maximum that you should not move a piece twice in the opening until all pieces are developed. You will find that this helps. The bishop move to b5 was an obvious error as was the knight manouvre so we can say that at least 3 moves early on were a waste of tempo. If given the opportunity to counter in the centre as you had with e4 where I pointed out then you must take it. I think this was actually a game lost thatn a game won by your opponent. The good thing is that you have noticed your errors so I am sure you can put these points right.

'break up his kingside pawns' - We see that he doesn't have to break up his pawns by capturing with the queen, which brings us to 'get his queen out where I can harass her' - here you need to calculate more concretely how you would do that, after which you might see that it would be difficult to harrass her since you are missing the dark-square bishop and one of the knights.

When your opponent meets your threat or your plan doesn't work out quite the way you wanted, you make another one. You had some good ideas about gaining space on the queenside (in particular, c4 was an excellent move). You made a positional error when you advanced c4-c5, since you gave your opponent the d5-square as well as creating a backward pawn on d4 (which came under attack later in the game). You wanted to claim the e5 square, which is a great idea, but your knight was stuck defending the weak pawn on d4. Here are some recommendations based on this game: 1. Analyze your plans to see if they are realistic much like I did quickly in the game. Sometimes, we have good ideas in general cases, but we must be specific to our situation where the idea might not work. 2. I always advise people to study tactics because it is one of the most important things you can do to improve. However, here I also suggest that you study positional elements. Some of your errors were positional errors which don't cause you to lose immediately, but added up as the game went on. For example, creating the backward pawn on d4 and trading your bishop for knight in the opening and allowing him to have the two bishops (which is usually an advantage in open positions). 3. Try to figure out your opponent's plans and threats. Assume they will play the best move in any position, and that way you can come closer to playing your best move. 4. After each game, write down your thoughts, plans, and analysis you had during the game. Then you can look at it (like I did in the note for Bg5) and make corrections. I do this often and have been making gradual progress in reducing my ""thinking"" errors. In summary, you did not make huge tactical errors, such as blundering a piece or the exchange. However, small errors and one-move plans allowed your opponent to accumulate small advantages which resulted in an eventual loss of material. Efforts to correct this will help you improve greatly. Good luck!"

H: Avoiding main-line theory is quite a sensible idea, especially if one doesn't want to spend a lot of time on opening preperation against an opening one doesn't face all that often. The downside is that in less forcing lines black can often get away with things he wouldn't usually be able to do. E.g. here black plays 5...e5, which certainly is a dubious move if white is willing to play an endgame, but the position offers white hardly anything in a middle game."

Looking it up on the web, I see that it's not unknown, but White seems to get a fairly comfortable endgame almost immediately, with pressure on the Black isolated d-pawn, which never has time to become an attacking tool. H: I entirely agree, since white can force an isolated queen's pawn on black and then immediately go into an endgame this move is rather questionable.

I thought that his queen would congest his position more than mine does for me, as my bishop has already moved out and I will be able to castle more easily. H: This is one of those cases were one has to choose between two quite tempting options. Either you get an endgame, in which he has an isolated queen's pawn (but active pieces) or you get a middle game, in which he will have to be slightly careful. If both continuations are equally strong, then it's more or less a matter of taste. However in this case I think that going for the endgame would have been the better option. The problem is that in the middlegame his isolated queen's pawn won't be much of a liability, so if black can untangle his kingside and avoid being overrun, then he will be fine after 9.Be3. I believe black can manage that, because white's pieces aren't quite active enough and he is lacking central pawns that he could push forwards."

Was there a better way for me to take advantage of Black's position at this point? Was I following the wrong plan? Should I have been pushing on the d-pawn? H: Actually this move (by itself) looks quite good, because it once more forces an exchange of queens (at least if white wants to - but your plan was to keep on looking for an advantage in the middlgame), but there isn't much white can do otherwise - black's pieces are just too active and well placed, therefore there just aren't any tactical opportunities at the moment. So basically I think, that yes, you have been following the wrong plan, there isn't much in the black position that suggests that one could outtactic him in the middlegame - except for the previously slightly akward queen position, which white couldn't really exploit - while the isolated d-pawn is something that is most easily exploited in an endgame."

My questions are thus: How could I have better taken advantage of his opening? (Was it even fishy?) Where, exactly, did I go wrong in the middlegame? (A deficiency in thinking?) Thank you for your help. H: Black's fifth move is weak, but to exploit it white has to go for an endgame, which might not be everyone's taste, especially if one is playing 1.e4. That endgame with the isolated pawn on d5 would have offered white good winning chances, while the middlegame (with queens on the board) you went for instead seems to be entirely okay for black even if the d-pawn remains a *potential* weakness. After that (as you pointed out) you missed a few tactical opportunities and hence allowed black to carry out his strategy, which eventually gave him a very good position. The typical strategies in positions with an isolated queen's pawn is for the side owning it to look for attacking chances in the middlegame, while the other side usually wants to swap pieces and reach an endgame. In this case you could have achieved this right away, so 9.Bg5 would have seemed like a good choice. Later you faced some strategic decisions, which are often difficult to make (swapping a bishop for a knight etc.), it is important to constantly reasses the value of each piece, for example the black pawn chain on the kingsside drastically reduced the value of your bishop, while on the other hand his knight obtained several nice outposts. But a bit later your bishop was quite a decent piece again on d4 (stabilising the white position) and swapping it off also resulted in immediate tactical problems. In the end you played the rook endgame much better than your opponent, who didn't look for active play at all and hence you eventually outplayed him. In addition to the many strategic decisions one had to make, both sides also missed quite a few tactical opportunities (as you noticed yourself), so you should always remember to watch out for them. Of course there are positions, where one should look especially hard to see whether there is a tactical solution. For example you quite correctly looked for such opportunities on move 24 (even if you miscalculated), on the other hand you might have spent too much time looking for them earlier in the game, because the black position was essentially pretty sound, but of course with the black queen in an unusual position one should always check quite carefully. Basically it comes down to spotting certain hints that indicate tactical opportunities, e.g. before on 24 the black minor pieces were in the line of fire of the white rooks and rather akwardly depending on each other, but then one has to calculate and check whether there is actually something there. I hope my review of this game helps you, if you have any further questions, you can always email me or ask me online."

My main comment would be you should expect the unexpected all the time because that it what usually occurs if that makes sense. You played a good game and was probably unlucky in the end. I think that by connecting rooks earlier and also by playing Raf8 before f5 you would have done better. Even so at move 38 Qa1+ would have seen you to the full point.

Is there a way to play that will pressure Black when he does this manouvre? With a such a closed centre, an immediate action is not possible. From e7, the Knight will go on g6 or f5, freeing the Bf8. White has to developp, hold the centre and pay attention to black counterattack which can be launched by two moves in such a position: or c7-c5 or f7-f6."

Finally, I found 6.h4 in a game of Fedorow, GMI. This last move is quite interesting and typical is this sort of position: the centre is closed, Black cannot attack it, so White gains space on the wing.

I want to expose the Black king. In the following moves I intend to do so, but my question here is... how sound is this plan? In the French, White usually attacks towards the kingisde and my pawns are definitely pointing that way. Would it have been more effective to double rooks on the f-file and fight back from there?

A1 Well it has to be black. Although the f-pawns are doubled this will add strength to the move e5 when it comes. These pawns should move forward as a unit over time. A2 Initially e7 which will support f6 allowing the freedom to move the bishop. A3 Now the king is out of the way the rooks are connected and either rooks to the g-file or perhaps better to c and d files look OK to me. You are right to say that your game starts to drift here. You do not connect your rooks, move the king or use your pawns effectively. You get passive and even the queen which was actually pressuring the queenside drifts to the poor square f8."

Care is needed though as swopping pieces is not always best when down on material at the end. A3 No not yet. If you are defending then one aim would be to make the board smaller.

One way to do this is to practice a simple technique which I started using when I found I was making these blunders: Before I make a move, I visualize the move and ask myself 'Can Black checkmate me? Can he take my queen? Can he take my rooks?' and so on. Although this seems like it would take a lot of time, you'd be amazed at how you can now count on not making simple blunders where you lose a piece or pawn, and it gets faster with practice. I do it almost automatically. Of course, I now make different types of mistakes, but I rarely hang a piece or pawn now. Of course, this might mean playing longer games, because it will take time to do this. Secondly, analyze your games thoroughly. When something happens in your game, such as when your opponent threatened the knight fork, you found that it was difficult to defend against it properly. When you analyze it, look back a couple moves and see where you can improve. That is how I analyzed your game in part...I looked at your mistakes and looked back and tried to find where you can improve it. If you do this diligently (it can be hard work) you will start to do this automatically in your games and start to avoid your problems. Finally, if you don't do so already, study tactical problems and tactics in general. Not only will you find these tactical shots for yourself, you will also see when your opponent makes a threat. I think if you do these things, you will see great improvement in the quality of your games, because you will start avoiding simple errors. As for openings, it should not be a priority in your study. You should study enough to get the general ideas, but you will improve much more through the above suggestions. Once you avoid dropping pieces and start noticing your opponent tactical threats (and are able to defend against them), then you will start needing to know more opening theory. Good luck!"""

r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/3bp3/4P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,e4d5,ok now white does not have a center and I do but lets first save my knight JK: I'd say white still has a centre - the pawn d5 presses into your position and takes the squares c6 and e6 away - and you're down a piece
r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/3Pp3/8/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,c6b4,"I guess 7... Ne7 would be better. Now 8. a3 would force you 8... Na6, and now white has the choice either to let your knight stay at the border (always bad for a knight) or exchange 9. Bxa6 bxa6 and give you a double pawn."
r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,c1g5,ok I expected that too and now I would like to get rid of that pawn but i dont like to see my knight pinned to my queen. that's why I played...
r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/3Pp1B1/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,f8e7,be7!?

r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/1B1Pp1B1/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 9,f6d7,"so I did it!mmm... looking now it's not so good as I thought. Now I'm going to loose 2 pieces more...and I'm one piece down... I should have moved my king instead...right? JK: Do you mind if I don't share your opinion? To me your last two moves were nearly the only moves you could play. Okay, more material maybe is leaving the board, and being down a piece that's bad, but you are left with the possibility to castle to either side and initiate an attack on the other wing. I see, you did that later on. Moving your king would have meant 9... Kf8; you are not allowed to castle any more and need several moves to get your rook on h8 into action."
r2qk2r/pppnBppp/3p4/1B1Pp3/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,d8e7,yes I was unfortunately right
r3k2r/pppq1ppp/3p4/3Pp3/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 12,e8c8,"ok I decided to castle queenside because I could have all my kingside pawns to develop till the white side.I was expecting to play qb5 to get that pawn right away. JK: As you noticed yourself and as I argued before, this was the best you could do in this situation - attack and hope that you can make up the minus-piece. But I do not understand what you say about 13... Qb5, since you attack d5 twice, by queen and knight, and white covers it twice as well, by queen and knight. And - of course - b5 is covered by the white knight."
2kr3r/pppq1ppp/3p4/3Pp3/1n6/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/R4RK1 b - - 3 13,f7f5,"for some reason white took a LOT to play and I forgot about my idea to get rid of the d5 pawn :) JK: As I told you before, there's no good chance to attack d5. Advancing on the king's wing was the best things you could do; you have a plan meanwhile the next moves show that white - despite of being up a piece - has no idea how to go on."
2kr3r/pppq2pp/3p4/3Ppp2/1n6/2N1QN1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 14,h8e8,"for some WEIRD (not to say stupid) reason i was concerned in centralizing my rook and TOTALLY missed the queen advancing possibility. JK: In my eyes the queen does not have good advancing possibilities. But now you change your plan; moving the rooks to the centre does not meet your original intention to attack on the kings side. Something like h6-g5-g4 and setting up the rooks in the g- or h-file would have done that. But of course you had to take care of your uncovered pawn on a7. I'd suggest 14... Kb8, and now white has to take care of its uncovered pawn c2."
2krr3/pppq2pp/3p4/3Ppp2/1n6/2N1QN1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - - 2 15,e3a7,"That surprised me because I was playing too fast. And the worst thing is the queen was all by herself...well, that might not be a bad thing at all."
2krr3/Qppq2pp/3p4/3Ppp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,c7c6,"I thought about opening some space; if he attacks c6 I'd have a queen to deffend it. If he checks me I'd have a scape as well. JK: Only your second-to best move. 15... c5 would have worked as well, because the queen omits 16. Nb5, and the pawn on c5 would cover your knight on b4. After 15... c5 white has nothing: 16. Qa8+ Kc7 17. Qa5+ Kb8 18. Nb5 Na6. After 15... c6 16. Qa8+ Kc7 17. Qa5+ Kb8 18. Qxb4 would have given another piece."

2krr3/Qp1q2pp/2Pp4/4pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 16,d7c6,and one less problem so deal with
2krr3/Qp4pp/2qp4/4pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 17,a7a8,"that surprised me too because it seems only to be a spite check. I thought he would have his rook centered I dont know... JK: You're right: Now your king's away from the threatening queen and white has to move his queen, while his pawn c2 is still uncovered. Interesting would have been 17. a3 with attack to the knight, because 17... Nxc2 18. Rac1 and now the white rook on c1 aims over the knights on queen and king in the c-file, which very fast will mean trouble."
Q1krr3/1p4pp/2qp4/4pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 17,c8d7,now I could do something to the queen
3rr3/1p1k2pp/2qp4/Q3pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 3 18,c6c5,"deffending my knight... its a pity I forgot I was one piece down and a pawn; i should have advanced my knight.. JK: I looked this over several times and found no way not to exchange queens. After 18... Nxc2 19. Rac1 forces your knight to d4, if you don't want to lose it. But after 19... Nd4 20. Nxd4 exd4 21. Nd5 your queen is captured. So maybe 18... Qc5, as sad as it is, is now one of the better moves, though white can exchange queens and the extra piece gets stroner and stronger."
3rr3/1p1k2pp/3p4/Q1q1pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - - 4 19,a5c5,and now queen exchange... good..
3rr3/1p1k2pp/3p4/2Q1pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 19,d6c5,for white of course... which probably checks me soon
3rr3/1p1k2pp/8/2p1pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 20,f1d1,there it goes... and as I was affraid of exchanging pieces again I played...
3rr3/1p1k2pp/8/2p1pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2R2K1 b - - 1 20,d7e7,"which later I realized was even worse because if white really would have decided to exchange pieces she would have done it the same way. Kc7 would have been definetly better JK: Sure, now e5 is uncovered and besides from losing another pawn the white knight gets a strong square in the centre of the board."
3rr3/1p2k1pp/8/2p1pp2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2R2K1 w - - 2 21,f3e5,AND i could also avoid to left e5 unprotected...
3rr3/1p2k1pp/8/2p1Np2/1n6/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2R2K1 b - - 0 21,e7f6,"By the way, this was your first chance to take on c2 (21... Nxc2)"
3rr3/1p4pp/5k2/2p1Np2/1n6/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2R2K1 w - - 1 22,d1d8,"new exchanging again... JK: This was not too well played from white, since after 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 black is alone in control over the d-file. Always see to get your rooks on open files, where they can reach far into opponent's space!I would have played something like 22. Nd3, maybe followed by 22... Nxc2 23. Rac1 Nd4 24. Bxc5"
3r4/1p4pp/5k2/2p2p2/1n6/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R5K1 b - - 1 23,b4c2,ok just one piece down...
3r4/1p4pp/5k2/2p2p2/8/2N2N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 w - - 0 24,c3b5,now I didnt see white's plan... why that knight on b5??? And I thought of all possibilities to that knight; Do white have a REAL plan? I took a long time to think about it...
3r4/1p4pp/5k2/1Np2p2/8/5N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 b - - 1 24,d8d3,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA... too late only after playing Rd3 I saw I could have eaten WHITE'S ROOK. That's it! I should really loose this one! I was only worried about the c2 pawn and white's plan I totally forgot to analyse my own pieces... JK: Of course, 24. Nb5 was a brutal mistake, throwing away the whole match. But apart from 24... Nxa1!!, what was the purpose of 24... Rd3? What does the rook do on d3 that he doesn't do on d8? A move should always improve the position of a piece in the one or other way, but the rook doesn't threat anything in the 3rd rank, since all pieces there are covered."
8/1p4pp/5k2/1Np2p2/8/3r1N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 w - - 2 25,b5c3,"men, you're not going to believe me now... as white played Nc3 I start it all over again - eg. why white did not retreat her rook??? and FORGOT about white's rook again thinking about other possibilities... I suck at this game sometimes... JK: I suppose white is simply nervous about being up a piece and having no plan how to exploit that. What I said before about your move also applies here: if you do a move, always think over what is the purpose of the move and why is the piece better on its new square than on its old square. Maybe the plan doesn't work, but you only learn by mistakes, not by moving around pieces without sense."
8/1p4pp/5k2/2p2p2/8/2Nr1N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 b - - 3 25,f5f4,"I have no idea why I played that move...(ok, ok yes I'm a woman before you wonder :) I think I was waiting for the en passant thing or something... JK: In my eyes the pawn on f5 was important, because it controlled e4. Now something like 26. Rc1 Nb4 27. Ne4+ Kf4 28. Nxc5 is possible."
8/1p4pp/5k2/2p5/5p2/2Nr1N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 w - - 0 26,c3e4,The check at once of course is not too clever for the Ra1 is still under attack
8/1p4pp/5k2/2p5/4Np2/3r1N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 b - - 1 26,f6f5,ok now I attack the knight and get the rook...with luck
8/1p4pp/8/2p2k2/4Np2/3r1N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 w - - 2 27,e4c5,man I have no explanation to the following move...
8/1p4pp/8/2N2k2/5p2/3r1N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 b - - 0 27,d3d5,"This was a good move! If 27... Nxa1 28. Nxd3, white is still up a piece and your knight is at the corner of the board, with a long way back into action. Now two white pieces, the rook and the knight, are attacked and white can only save one of them."
8/1p4pp/8/2Nr1k2/5p2/5N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 w - - 1 28,c5b7,"I think I was tired and did not see that. JK: Forget about that pawn. You get white's rook, and after being down a piece for about twenty moves, material now is about even. Maybe 28. Rc1 would have kept an advantage for white: 28... Rxc5 29. Rxc2 Rxc2 30. Nd4+ Ke4 31. Nxc2 - but who is able to calculate that far?"
8/1N4pp/8/3r1k2/5p2/5N1P/PPn2PP1/R5K1 b - - 0 28,c2a1,"but finally... that's it... then the connection was lost. Thanks for your comments but please be kind... I'm a begginner. JK: You have the exchange (rook for a knight or bishop), and as a compensation white has two extra pawns. As a rule of thumb, a rook is worth five pawns and a knight and a bishop are each worth three pawns; thus, the material is about even. White is now probably trying to promote the a- or the b-pawn. If they move, covered by each other and the two knights, black has to try a lot to stop them. But if they are stopped, the black rook probably wins the match; always provided, that neither side blunders a piece. The match is totally open and exciting."
